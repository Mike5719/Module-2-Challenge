Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio


Description:

In this Challenge we were asked to create a portfolio page from scratch to showcase our skills and talents to employers looking to fill a position. This Challenge gave us the opportunity to apply recently learned core skills including flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

I've included the provided User Story and Acceptance Criteria below.

User Story:

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

The camera, tablet, toilet paper, wooden-spoons images in the images folder were sourced from Advanced CSS Activities coursework. These images are being used as placeholders and will be replaced as I complete more web applications throuout the program.

The contents of the reset.css file were copied from Advanced CSS Activities coursework.

I used the following tutorial to learn how to link anchor tags to elements on the same page --> https://www.semrush.com/blog/html-anchor/#anchor-tag-examples
